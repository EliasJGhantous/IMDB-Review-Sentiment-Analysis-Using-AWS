# IMDB-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-AWS
This is a repository of a project done to analyze IMDB reviews using Amazon Web Services Sagemaker. Model is trained using PyTorch and a web app is then created and deployed for use. For this project, I set up a lambda and an API Gateway using Sagemaker and trained the model using Amazon's servers.
